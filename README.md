The repository contains the implementation for the final dashboard project done for CSE 564 - Visualization. 


CSE 564 - Visualization 

Our code implementation is in JavaScript, Python and JQuery. Most of the pre- processing part has been done in python. It includes data cleaning and restruc- turing such as a pivoting. We would like to mention that we used Geo-Map[7], a d3 extension library for geographical projections. Python-Flask framework was used to setup the endpoints for REST calls.


How to Setup :
1. Install mongodb and run it using "mongod" on port 27017
2. run the Flask framework using "python app.py"
3. Go to the browser at port 5000
